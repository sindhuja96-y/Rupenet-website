        belong to Rupenet Technology Solutions Private Limited.</p>
      <p>Rupenet Technology Solutions Private Limited is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient
        as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at
        any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear
        to you exactly what you’re paying for.</p>
      <p>The Rupenet eWallet App app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, to provide our
        Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that
        you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations
        imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to
        malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the Rupenet
        eWallet App app won’t work properly or at all.</p>
      <p>The app does use third-party services that declare their Terms and Conditions.</p>
      <p>Link to Terms and Conditions of third-party service providers used by the app * [Google Play
        Services](https://policies.google.com/terms) * [Google Analytics for
        Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/terms/analytics) * [Firebase

      <p>You should be aware that there are certain things that Rupenet Technology Solutions Private Limited will not
        take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet
        connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but Rupenet Technology
        Solutions Private Limited cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t
        have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.</p>
      <p>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement with
        your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the
        cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In using
        the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app
        outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the
        bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received
        permission from the bill payer for using the app.</p>
      <p>Along the same lines, Rupenet Technology Solutions Private Limited cannot always take responsibility for the
        way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and
        you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Rupenet Technology Solutions Private Limited cannot accept
        responsibility.</p>
      <p>With respect to Rupenet Technology Solutions Private Limited’s responsibility for your use of the app, when
        you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and
        correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available
        to you. Rupenet Technology Solutions Private Limited accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you
        experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</p>
      <p>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – the requirements for
        the system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and
        you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Rupenet Technology Solutions Private
        Limited does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the
        Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the
        application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any
        time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
        rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed)
        delete it from your device.
